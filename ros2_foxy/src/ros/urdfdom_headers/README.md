### Using with ROS

If you choose to check this repository out for use with ROS, be aware that the necessary ``package.xml`` is not 
included in this repo but instead is added in during the ROS release process. To emulate this, pull the appropriate
file into this repository using the following format. Be sure to replace the ALLCAPS words with the appropriate terms:

```
wget https://raw.github.com/ros-gbp/urdfdom_headers-release/debian/ROS_DISTRO/UBUNTU_DISTRO/urdfdom_headers/package.xml
```
