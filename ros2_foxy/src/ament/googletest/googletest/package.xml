  We add 900 to the patch part of the version and then multiply it by 10,
  i.e. our version = `(upstream_patch_version + 900) * 10`,
  so we can have intermediate releases as well as release any future official 1.8.x versions.

  This is basically packing the patch part of the version and a fourth version part together
  into the third part of the version.

  The use of `900` instead of something else like `100` is arbitrary, but it might
  help people recognize that this is a "special" version number.
  It is needed however, because we cannot have a leading `0` in our patch version.

  Consider these possible future versions as an example:

  1.8.9000 -> current state of this repository, 1.8.0 + some commits from us and upstream
  1.8.9010 -> upstream 1.8.1
  1.8.9011 -> upstream 1.8.1 + additional commits from upstream or us
  1.8.9012 -> upstream 1.8.1 + additional commits from 1.8.1011 + more new commits
  1.8.9020 -> upstream 1.8.2
  and so on...

  This is planned to be temporary until we vendor package this, but for now
  it will allow us to be flexible.
