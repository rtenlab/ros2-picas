\b qt_gui_cpp provides the foundation for C++-bindings for qt_gui and creates bindings for every generator available.
At least one specific binding must be available in order to use C++-plugins.

The code API of qt_gui_cpp (except the exposed interfaces for plugins, namely qt_gui_cpp::Plugin and qt_gui_cpp::PluginContext) is not stable, so it is not recommended for use in other tools.
