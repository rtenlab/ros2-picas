Using static discovery
----------------------

When static discovery is active, remote endpoints are passed to the application via an xml file.

To see a code example of this feature, review test "StaticDiscovery" of the Blackbox suite.
You will need to copy the two xml files present in this folder to the folder you run the tests from.

These sample xml files contain a reader and a writer with a single writers/reader with custon Locators.
These files can be used as a starting point. The full list of fields and attributes can be taken from
EDPSimpleXML.cpp

NOTE: Locator fields are read as Attributes, not Sub-Fields. Passing the arguments via Attributes creates
and invalid Locator.
