------------------

0.6.5 (2016-12-10)
------------------
* hamonized versions
* styled and sorted CMakeLists.txt
  * removed boilerplate comments
  * indention
  * reviewed exported dependencies
* styled and sorted package.xml
* Removes gtest from test dependencies.
  This dependency is covered by the rosunit dependency.
* Removes dependency on Boost, adds rosunit dependency.
  The dependency on Boost was unnecessary, rosunit is required for gtest.
* Improves StateInterface implementation of the DummyInterface.
  The doesLoopBack() method now returns the correct value. A state change is
  correctly dispatched when the init() method is called.
* Changes the exit code of the nodes if device init fails.
  Now exits with 1 if the initialization of the can device fails.
* Changes the frame field for the published messages.
  An empty frame name is more commonly used to denote that there is no frame
  associated with the message.
* Changes return type of setup() method.
  Setup() calls the CreateMsgListener and CreateStateListener, it does not attempt
  to verify if the interface is ready, which makes void more applicable.
* Cleanup, fixes and improvements in CmakeLists.
  Adds the REQUIRED COMPONENTS packages to the CATKIN_DEPENDS.
  Improves add_dependency on the messages to be built.
  Removes unnecessary FILES_MATCHING.
  Moves the roslint_cpp macro to the testing block.
* Finalizes work on the socketcan_bridge and can_msgs.
  Readies the packages socketcan_bridge and can_msgs for the merge with ros_canopen.
  Bumps the version for both packages to 0.1.0. Final cleanup in CMakeLists, added
  comments to the shell script and launchfile used for testing.
* Adds tests for socketcan_bridge and bugfixes.
  Uses rostests and the modified DummyInterface to test whether behaviour
  is correct. Prevented possible crashes when can::tostring was called on
  invalid frames.
* Adds conversion test between msg and SocketCAN Frame.
  This test only covers the conversion between the can_msgs::Frame message and can::Frame from SocketCAN.
* Introduces topic_to_socketcan and the bridge.
  Adds TopicToSocketCAN, the counterpart to the SocketCANToTopic class.
  Also introduces a node to use this class and a node which combines the two
  classes into a bidirectional bridge.
  Contrary to the previous commit message the send() method appears to be
  available from the ThreadedSocketCANInterface afterall.
* Introduces socketcan_to_topic and its node.
  This is based on the ThreadedSocketCANInterface from the socketcan_interface package. Sending might become problematic with this class however, as the send() method is not exposed through the Threading wrappers.
