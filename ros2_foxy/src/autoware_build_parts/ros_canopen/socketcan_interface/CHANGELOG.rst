0.7.3 (2017-04-25)
------------------

0.7.2 (2017-03-28)
------------------

0.7.1 (2017-03-20)
------------------
* stop CAN driver on read errors as well
* expose socketcan handle
* implemented BCMsocket
* introduced BufferedReader::readUntil
* Contributors: Mathias Lüdtke

0.7.0 (2016-12-13)
------------------

0.6.5 (2016-12-10)
------------------
* removed Baseclass typedef since its use prevented virtual functions calls
* add missing chrono dependency
* Added catch-all features in BufferedReader
* hardened code with the help of cppcheck
* styled and sorted CMakeLists.txt
  * removed boilerplate comments
  * indention
  * reviewed exported dependencies
* styled and sorted package.xml
* update package URLs
* Improves StateInterface implementation of the DummyInterface.
  The doesLoopBack() method now returns the correct value. A state change is
  correctly dispatched when the init() method is called.
* Changes inheritance of DummyInterface to DriverInterface.
  Such that this interface can also be used for tests requiring a DriverInterface
  class.
  Test results of the socketcan_interface tests are unchanged by this
  modification as it only uses the CommInterface methods.
* added socketcan_interface_string to test
* moved string functions into separate lib
* Introduced setNotReady, prevent enqueue() to switch from closed to open
* Reading state\_ should be protected by lock
* improved BufferedReader interface and ScopedEnabler
* added flush() and max length support to BufferedReader
* added BufferedReader
* wake multiple waiting threads if needed
* pad hex buffer strings in all cases
* removed unstable StateWaiter::wait_for

* tostring fixed for headers
* removed empty test
* added DummyInterface with first test
* added message string helper
* added missing include
